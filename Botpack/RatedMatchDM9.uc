     Bio(0)="Arys is a field commander from the 12th Mechanized Imperial. She was selected for Tournament play after she single handedly killed 8 Skaarj with an energy knife during the battle for the Orion Stormwatch Outpost."
     Bio(1)="Blake is back and he's pissed. The first time you fought him, he lacked a lot of skill and tone, but now he thinks he can take you on. Show him where to stick it."
     Bio(2)="Genghis takes his name from a conquerer of old. He proclaims himself 'Ruler of the Eastern Expanse' come to forge a new Empire. In reality, he is a petty freight raider sentenced to fight in the Tournament for his crimes."
     Bio(3)="Kryss isn't out of the Tournament yet. The Necris are persistent and dangerous and she is no exception. Be careful, she is definitely more powerful than before."
     Bio(4)="Azure has served six long years on Mars for reasons that are currently classified. She was recently transferred to the Tournament, but no records of her history are available."
